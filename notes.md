## flashcard creation
for now, it looks like the only way to create a flashcard is if we attach it to a topicId which is then attached to a flashcard
but we're not creating any topic, how can we implement this or should we look for alternatives?

creating topics seems to be problematic. 

## alternative
take each course as a topic to study, then attach the flashcards to this courseId(which in reality would be a topic)

## alternative
take the  first message in a conversation (message we use to create a steps list) as the topic for this conversation and store it in the database
